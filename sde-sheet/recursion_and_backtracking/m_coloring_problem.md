## m-coloring Problem

Given an undirected graph and an integer M. The task is to determine if the graph can be colored with at most M colors such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with the same color. Here coloring of a graph means the assignment of colors to all vertices. Print 1 if it is possible to colour vertices and 0 otherwise.

```bash
Example 1:

Input:
N = 4, M = 3, E = 5
Edges[] = {(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0),(0,2)}
Output: 1
```
